## 1. What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?
A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** integrates all essential components of a computer system into a **single chip**, including CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnects.  
This allows for **compact size, low power consumption, cost efficiency, and high performance**, making SoCs ideal for smartphones, wearables, tablets, and embedded systems.

## 2. Key Components of a Typical SoC

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CPU** | Executes instructions, the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the SoC. |
| **Memory** | RAM (temporary) and ROM/Flash (permanent) for data storage. |
| **I/O Ports** | Interfaces for communication with external devices. |
| **GPU** | Renders visuals, animations, and video. |
| **DSP** | Specialized processor for audio, video, and signal processing. |
| **PMU** | Manages power consumption and efficiency. |
| **Clock & Timing** | Often uses PLLs to synchronize system operations. |
| **Analog Components / DAC** | Converts digital outputs to analog signals for external devices. |

## 3. Types of SoCs

| Type | Features | Example Applications |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| Microcontroller-based | Simple, low-power, minimal processing | IoT devices, home appliances |
| Microprocessor-based | Supports OS, multitasking, higher processing | Smartphones, tablets |
| Application-Specific (ASIC) | Custom-designed for high performance | AI accelerators, graphics cards |

## 4. Introduction to VSDBabySoC
**VSDBabySoC** is a compact RISC-V-based SoC designed for **learning and experimentation**.  
It facilitates **simultaneous testing of three open-source IP cores** and calibration of analog components.

**Key Features:**
- **RVMYTH CPU** ‚Äì Processes instructions and drives DAC inputs.  
- **PLL** ‚Äì Generates a stable, synchronized clock for CPU and DAC.  
- **10-bit DAC** ‚Äì Converts digital signals from CPU into analog output for external devices.

## 5. BabySoC Functional Flow

| Stage | Function |
|-------|---------|
| **Initialization & Clocking** | PLL locks to input reference and generates a stable clock. |
| **Data Processing (RVMYTH CPU)** | Updates r17 register sequentially with values for DAC conversion. |
| **Analog Output (DAC)** | Converts digital values into analog signals, saved in `OUT`, for devices like TVs or speakers. |

---

## 6. Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)
A **PLL** synchronizes output frequency with an input reference.  

**Components:**
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Phase Detector | Compares input and feedback signals; outputs error voltage. |
| Loop Filter | Smooths error voltage to produce control voltage. |
| VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator) | Adjusts frequency based on control voltage to match reference. |

**Function:** Locks output frequency and phase to the input; may use feedback dividers to multiply frequency.

</p>


**Why Off-Chip Clocks Are Limited:**  
- Distribution delays, jitter, and varying block frequency requirements.  
- Crystal frequency deviation, stability issues, and aging can reduce timing accuracy.
