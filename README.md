# Introduction to the VSDBabySoC

VSDBabySoC is a small yet powerful RISCV-based SoC. The main purpose of designing such a small SoC is to test three open-source IP cores together for the first time and calibrate the analog part of it. VSDBabySoC contains one RVMYTH microprocessor, an 8x-PLL to generate a stable clock, and a 10-bit DAC to communicate with other analog devices.

## Problem statement

This work discusses the different aspects of designing a small SoC based on RVMYTH (a RISCV-based processor). This SoC will leverage a PLL as its clock generator and controller and a 10-bit DAC as a way to talk to the outside world. Other electrical devices with proper analog input like televisions, and mobile phones could manipulate DAC output and provide users with music sound or video frames. At the end of the day, it is possible to use this small fully open-source and well-documented SoC which has been fabricated under Sky130 technology, for educational purposes.

## What is SoC

An SoC is a single-die chip that has some different IP cores on it. These IPs could vary from microprocessors (completely digital) to 5G broadband modems (completely analog).

## What is RVMYTH

RVMYTH core is a simple RISCV-based CPU, introduced in a workshop by RedwoodEDA and VSD. During a 5-day workshop students (including middle-schoolers) managed to create a processor from scratch. The workshop used the TLV for faster development. All of the present and future contributions to the IP will be done by students and under open-source licenses.

## What is PLL

A phase-locked loop or PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. PLLs are widely used for synchronization purposes, including clock generation and distribution.

## What is DAC

A digital-to-analog converter or DAC is a system that converts a digital signal into an analog signal. DACs are widely used in modern communication systems enabling the generation of digitally-defined transmission signals. As a result, high-speed DACs are used for mobile communications and ultra-high-speed DACs are employed in optical communications systems.

# VSDBabySoC Modeling

Here we are going to model and simulate the VSDBabySoC using `iverilog`, then we will show the results using `gtkwave` tool. Some initial input signals will be fed into `vsdbabysoc` module that make the pll start generating the proper `CLK` for the circuit. The clock signal will make the `rvmyth` to execute instructions in its `imem`. As a result the register `r17` will be filled with some values cycle by cycle. These values are used by dac core to provide the final output signal named `OUT`. So we have 3 main elements (IP cores) and a wrapper as an SoC and of-course there would be also a testbench module out there.

Please note that in the following sections we will mention some repos that we used to model the SoC. However the main source code is resided in [Source-Code Directory](src) and these modules are in [Modules Sub-Directory](src/module).

## RVMYTH modeling

As we mentioned in [What is RVMYTH](#what-is-rvmyth) section, RVMYTH is designed and created by the TL-Verilog language. So we need a way for compile and trasform it to the Verilog language and use the result in our SoC. Here the `sandpiper-saas` could help us do the job.

  [Here](https://github.com/shivanishah269/risc-v-core) is the repo we used as a reference to model the RVMYTH

## PLL and DAC modeling

It is not possible to sythesis an analog design with Verilog, yet. But there is a chance to simulate it using `real` datatype. We will use the following repositories to model the PLL and DAC cores:

  1. [Here](https://github.com/vsdip/rvmyth_avsdpll_interface) is the repo we used as a reference to model the PLL
  2. [Here](https://github.com/vsdip/rvmyth_avsddac_interface) is the repo we used as a reference to model the DAC

## Step by step modeling walkthrough

In this section we will walk you through the whole process of modeling the VSDBabySoC in details. We will increase/decrease the digital output value and feed it to the DAC model so we can watch the changes on the SoC output. Please, note that the following commands are tested on the Ubuntu Bionic platform and no other OSes.

  1. First we need to install some important packages:

  ```
  $ sudo apt install python python3-pip git iverilog gtkwave
  $ cd ~
  $ pip3 install sandpiper-saas
  ```

  2. Now you can clone this repository in arbitrary directory (we'll choose home directory here):

  ```
  $ cd ~
  $ git clone https://github.com/manili/VSDBabySoC.git
  ```

  3. It's time to run the compiling script:

  ```
  $ cd VSDBabySoC/src
  $ chmod +x ./pre_synth_sim.sh
  $ ./pre_synth_sim.sh
  ```
  
  Any outputs will be stored in `pre_synth_sim` directory.

  4. You can watch the waveforms with following command:

  ```
  $ cd ../pre_synth_sim
  $ gtkwave pre_synth_sim.vcd
  ```
  
  Two most important signals are `CLK` and `OUT`. The `CLK` signal is provided by the PLL and the `OUT` is the output of the DAC model. Here is the final result of the modeling process:

# VSDBabySoC physical design



## OpenLane installation

* OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault,SPEF-Extractor and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization.
The OpenLANE and sky130 installation can be done by following the steps in this repository `https://github.com/nickson-jose/openlane_build_script`.

* More information on OpenLANE can be found in this repository `https://github.com/efabless/openlane` .

* After finishing off the installation, the first step in the design flow is to synthesize the generated RTL code.

## Synthesizing using Yosys

* In OpenLane the RTL synthesis is performed by `yosys`.
* The technology mapping is performed by `abc`.
* Finally, the timing reports are generated for the resulting synthesized netlist by `OpenSTA`.

### How to synthesize the design

To perform the synthesis process just do the following:

  ```
  $ cd ~/VSDBabySoC/src
  $ chmod +x ./post_synth_sim.sh
  $ ./post_synth_sim.sh
  ```

The heavy job will be done by the script.

### Post-synthesis simulation (GLS)

There is an issue for post-synthesis simulation (Gate-Level Simulation) which can be tracked [here](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk/issues/310).
