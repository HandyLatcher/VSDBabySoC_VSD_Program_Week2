# ‚ö° Fundamentals of SoC Design and VSDBabySoC Journey

## 1. What is a System on Chip (SoC)?
A **System on Chip (SoC)** integrates multiple components of a computer system into a single chip.  
Instead of using separate ICs for CPU, memory, and I/O, SoCs combine them for **efficiency, compactness, and performance**.

## 2. üîë Key Components of an SoC

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **CPU** | Executes instructions, acts as the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the system. |
| **Memory** | RAM (temporary storage), ROM/Flash (permanent storage). |
| **I/O Ports** | Interfaces for external communication (USB, camera, audio, etc.). |
| **GPU** | Handles graphics, images, and video rendering. |
| **DSP** | Optimized for audio/video and signal processing. |
| **Power Mgmt.** | Controls power distribution for efficiency. |
| **Special Features** | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, security modules, etc. |

## 5. üß© VSDBabySoC ‚Äì A Learning Platform
The **VSDBabySoC** is a compact SoC based on **RISC-V (RVMYTH CPU)**.  
It integrates both **digital** (CPU, logic) and **analog** (PLL, DAC) components, making it an ideal educational design.  

| Component | Role in BabySoC |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **RVMYTH (RISC-V CPU)** | Executes instructions, updates registers, drives DAC inputs |
| **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)** | Generates stable clock signals, synchronizes system timing |
| **DAC (10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter)** | Converts digital signals into analog output (audio/video) |

## 6. ‚öôÔ∏è How BabySoC Works
1. **Initialization & Clocking** ‚Üí PLL locks onto reference clock, provides stable timing.  
2. **Data Processing** ‚Üí RVMYTH CPU executes instructions, updates registers.  
3. **Analog Output** ‚Üí DAC converts processed digital data ‚Üí analog signals for external devices.

## 7. üìò Key Learnings
- SoC = integration of CPU, memory, and analog/digital blocks in one chip.  
- PLL = ensures **stable synchronized clocking** across the SoC.  
- DAC = enables **real-world interfacing** (audio/video outputs).  
- **VSDBabySoC** bridges the gap between **theory and practice** in open-source silicon design.
